## üí° Project Overview & Impact

Roomable addresses the common challenge students face in finding available study spaces on a busy university campus. By leveraging real-time sensor data and a mobile-first approach, it transforms the user experience from guesswork to instant, informed decision-making. This project demonstrates the integration of IoT concepts with robust mobile application development and cloud-based backend services to solve a practical, everyday problem.

## ü§ñ Hardware System

The real-time availability data for Roomable is collected by an integrated hardware system. Each study room is equipped with:

* **Microcontroller:** An **ESP32** (or similar Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller) is used to process sensor readings and transmit data.
* **Ultrasonic Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04):** Measures distance to detect occupancy. If an object (like a person) is within a certain range, the room is considered occupied.
* **Sound Sensor:** Monitors ambient noise levels within the room, providing additional context to occupancy status.

This hardware continuously gathers data, which is then sent to the Firebase Realtime Database to update the mobile application in real-time.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

To get Roomable up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/roomable.git](https://github.com/your-username/roomable.git)
    cd roomable
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser. You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone, or press `a` for Android Emulator / `i` for iOS Simulator.

**Note:** For detailed setup of Node.js, Expo CLI, Android/iOS development environments, Firebase configuration, and troubleshooting, please refer to the [Detailed Setup & Troubleshooting Guide](FULL_SETUP_GUIDE.md).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Firebase Integration

Roomable connects to a Firebase Realtime Database to fetch real-time study room availability status.

* **Database URL:** `https://study-room-availability-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com`
* **Data Path:** The app listens to the `/sensor` path for room status, distance, and sound data.
* **Configuration:** Firebase connection is configured in `config/firebase.js`.
* **Mobile Configuration Files:**
    * `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) is included in the repository.
    * For Android, download `google-services.json` from your Firebase Console and place it in the project root.

## üìÅ Project Structure

* `/app`: Main application code using Expo Router for navigation (`index.tsx`, `floor/[id].tsx`, `room/[id].tsx`).
* `/hooks`: Custom React hooks, including Firebase data fetching hooks.
* `/config`: Configuration files, including Firebase setup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Detailed Setup & Troubleshooting

For comprehensive instructions on installing prerequisites (Node.js, Expo CLI, Android/iOS development environments), detailed Firebase configuration, and common troubleshooting steps, please see the [FULL_SETUP_GUIDE.md](FULL_SETUP_GUIDE.md) file in this repository.
