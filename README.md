## üí° Project Overview & Impact

Roomable addresses the common challenge students face in finding available study spaces on a busy university campus. By leveraging real-time sensor data and a mobile-first approach, it transforms the user experience from guesswork to instant, informed decision-making. This project demonstrates the integration of IoT concepts with robust mobile application development and cloud-based backend services to solve a practical, everyday problem.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

To get Roomable up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/roomable.git](https://github.com/your-username/roomable.git)
    cd roomable
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser. You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone, or press `a` for Android Emulator / `i` for iOS Simulator.

**Note:** For detailed setup of Node.js, Expo CLI, Android/iOS development environments, Firebase configuration, and troubleshooting, please refer to the [Detailed Setup & Troubleshooting Guide](FULL_SETUP_GUIDE.md).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Firebase Integration

Roomable connects to a Firebase Realtime Database to fetch real-time study room availability status.

* **Database URL:** `https://study-room-availability-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com`
* **Data Path:** The app listens to the `/sensor` path for room status, distance, and sound data.
* **Configuration:** Firebase connection is configured in `config/firebase.js`.
* **Mobile Configuration Files:**
    * `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) is included in the repository.
    * For Android, download `google-services.json` from your Firebase Console and place it in the project root.

## üìÅ Project Structure

* `/app`: Main application code using Expo Router for navigation (`index.tsx`, `floor/[id].tsx`, `room/[id].tsx`).
* `/hooks`: Custom React hooks, including Firebase data fetching hooks.
* `/config`: Configuration files, including Firebase setup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Detailed Setup & Troubleshooting
